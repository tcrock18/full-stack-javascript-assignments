# Assignment: Strings and Regular expressions

## Requirements

1. Assign the greeting message to `'Hello World'`.
2. Create and export a variable `export const characterAt = ???` that retrieves the 4th charater in the greeting variable.
3. Create and export a variable `export const greetingArray = ???` that converts the hello world to an array ([ 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd' ])
4. Create and export a variable `begins(str, char)` tthat creates a function that the string begins with a char 
  ```
  export const begins = (str, char) => { 
    return ???
  };
  ```
5.  Create and export a variable `beginsInsensitive(str, char)` that creates a function that determines that the string begins with a char 
   ```
   export const beginsInsensitive = (str, char) => { 
     return ???
   };
   ```

## Discussion

1. What is a string's data type really? (Discussed in class)
2. What are some functions that overlap with other types?
3. What is RegEx used for?
